### How does the DevBoard handle received serial messages? How does this differ from the na√Øve approach?
The DevBoard checks if the serial port's receive buffer is not empty and when triggered it validates the data received. It is different because there is two-way communication between computer and DevBoard which makes it possible to check for invalid states.

### What does `detached_callback` do? What would happen if it wasn't used?
It allows code to be spawned into a thread, making the function run simultaneous with other functions. Not using this would cause freezing when a section takes too much time to run

### What does `LockedSerial` do? Why is it _necessary_?
It prevents multiple threads to access the serial port at once. If not in place, it could lead to undefined behavior.
